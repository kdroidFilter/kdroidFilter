# kdroidFilter - Elie Gambache

**Clean code. Solid architecture. Blazing performance.**

I don't chase guaranteed wins — I hunt impossible problems and turn them into elegant solutions.

## What drives me

- **Performance obsession**: Making things run faster than they should
- **Architecture purist**: Clean, maintainable, scalable systems
- **Magic seeker**: When complex becomes simple through the right abstraction

## Current focus

**Kotlin & Compose** — because they make the impossible feel effortless:
- Coroutines for async perfection
- Declarative UI that thinks like logic
- Zero-cost abstractions that don't compromise speed

## Philosophy

```kotlin
// This is what excites me
suspend fun impossible(): Magic {
    return cleanArchitecture()
        .withPerformance()
        .solveWhatOthersCant()
}
```
